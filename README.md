# Turborepo starter with shadcn/ui, Postgres


## Using this example

Clone the repository:
Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Add ui components

Use the pre-made script:

```sh
pnpm ui add <component-name>
```

> This works just like the `shadcn/ui` CLI.

### Add a new app

Turborepo offer a simple command to add a new app:

```sh
pnpm turbo gen workspace --name <app-name>
```

This will create a new empty app in the `apps` directory.

If you want, you can copy an existing app with:

```sh
pnpm turbo gen workspace --name <app-name> --copy
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to run `pnpm install` after copying an app.

### Database scripts

View package.json for the scripts


### Build

pnpm build
```

### Develop

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd <project name>
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```sh
npx turbo link
```
